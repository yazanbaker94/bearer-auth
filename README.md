How do I install the app or library?

Clone repo on your local machine
Open terminal, run npm i
Run your postgress server
Create a database called 'testing'
Change the postgress url to /testing
Create an .env file and add your PORT='PORTNUMBER' to run the server on, create a DATABASE_URL with your postgress localhost server, and create a SECRET with your secret word in the .env

Run ThunderBird, add a POST request localhost:PORT/signup with username and password, have it saved in the SQL DB locally. You will receive a token.

After that, go /signin using thunderbird POST, but use the AUTH section and enter the username and password, and let the request compare your user/pass with the ones saved locally. You will see your token.

Then, go to to /users using thunderbird with a GET request, and enter the token generated in the AUTH section of the Bearer Auth. This will view all the users in the DB.

At last, go to /secret using thunderbird with a GET request, using the token in the BEARER AUTH fields of the AUTH section and request it, you will see the secret page.

How do I test the app or library? 
cd into the directory, run npm test, you will see both tests for signin/signup/users/secret pass
